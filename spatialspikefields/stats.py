def sparsity(rate_map, px):
    '''
    Compute sparsity of a rate map, The sparsity  measure is an adaptation
    to space. The adaptation measures the fraction of the environment  in which
    a cell is  active. A sparsity of, 0.1 means that the place field of the
    cell occupies 1/10 of the area the subject traverses [2]_

    Parameters
    ----------
    rate_map : numpy.ndarray
        A firing rate map, any number of dimensions.

    Returns

def information_rate(rate_map, px):
    '''
    Compute information rate of a cell given variable x.
    A simple algorithm devised by [1]_. This computes the spatial information
    rate of cell spikes given variable x (e.g. position, head direction) in
    bits/second. This function is copied from Lucas Solanka, Matt Nolans lab

    Parameters
    ----------
    rate_map : numpy.ndarray
        A firing rate map, any number of dimensions. If units are in Hz, then
        the information rate will be in bits/s.
    px : numpy.ndarray
        Probability density function for variable ``x``. ``px.shape`` must be
        equal ``rate_maps.shape``

    Returns
    -------
    I : float
        Information rate.

    Notes
    -----
    Quote from [1]_:
    "To get the basic idea, imagine we are recording the activity of a neuron
    in the brain of a rat, while the rat is wandering around randomly on a
    circular platform. Suppose we observe that the cell fires only when the
    rat is on the left half of the platform, and that it fires at a constant
    rate everywhere on the left half; and suppose that on the whole the rat
    spends half of its time on the left half of the platform. In this case, if
    we are prevented from seeing where the rat is, but are informed that the
    neuron has just this very moment fired a spike, we obtain thereby one bit
    of information about the current location of the rat. Suppose we have a
    second cell, which fires only in the southwest quarter of the platform; in
    this case a spike would give us two bits of information. If there were in
    addition a small amount of background firing, the information would be
    slightly less than two bits. And so on.". Invalid positions are masked with
    ``np.nan`` and replaced with 0.
